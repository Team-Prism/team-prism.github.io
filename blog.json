                "Hey there. Welcome to this thing. This is a webcomic that myself and the other people listed <a onclick='aboutPage(true)' href='#about'>in the about page</a> have been working on.",
                "This web comic project started because we wanted to create a game or something, but every time we had an idea, it was either to big of a project that we didn't really want to work on it, or it was so boring or simple, because we thought we need something simple as a first project, that we would work on it for an afternoon and then give up.",
                "Heres hoping this project lasts longer than those projects.",
                "Anyways, I thought I would take the time to write this first post and explain a few things about the website and how it works so you will hopefully have the best experience possible.",
                "Before I go over the features though, I would like to mention that there is no good mobile support on the website yet (Sorry phone gang), but it is planned, and will be here soon! Another thing to keep in mind is that things are probably going to change a bit in the coming months in terms of layout and styling of the website, so this will probably be inaccurate at some point.",
                "<br>At the top of the page is what is called the header. On it are 5 buttons.",
                "The 'Home' button is what this main page is. It will have these posts, which will contain updates about the website, and news regarding the state of the comic.",
                "The 'Story' button will take you to the story page, which is where you will be able to read the comic.",
                "The 'About' button will take you to the about page which has currently has links to view the source code (thats right, its open source!) and to join our discord server, and it also has an option to enable notifications, and also lists the members of Team Prism, and their roles on the project. It also has some debug info that you don't need to worry about unless you are reporting a bug with the website (which you should totally do if you find one!).",
                "The 'Theme' button will allow you to switch between dark theme and light theme. If you hold control while you click it, it will reset to defaulting to your system dark theme preference if available, otherwise, it will default to dark theme.",
                "The 'Wide' button will switch between the narrow page style that gives off twitter vibes with the amount of wasted space, and the wider page style that takes up more of the page ideal for people on desktop. Or really large screens. Up to you.",
                "If you are using Google Chrome or the new Microsoft Edge (Might also work in Safari, but Firefox does not support this feature yet), you should see a + button in the URL bar which you can use to 'install' an application like version of the website. Doing so will allow you to access some parts of the website more quickly from shortcuts.",
                "<br>On the story page, there are a few buttons you can click on to navigate between pages.",
                "Index will bring you to the index page, which you can use to navigate pages somewhat quickly, rather than just using the previous and next buttons.",
                "Unread will bring you to (hopefully) the first unread page you have. The way it figures it out is kinda jank though, so you should keep track of it somewhere if you don't want to lose your spot!",
                "The previous and next buttons will navigate to the previous and next page in relation to the current page.",
                "The first page and last page buttons will bring you to the very first page and most recent page respectively.",
                "<br><br>Some info for more technical users. Feel free to look at the source code on github, and if you find any issues or want to add a feature or improve an existing one, you can make an issue or a pull request.",
                "Thanks for checking this out, and I hope you enjoy reading the comic. Once we actually release some pages."
